		<p style="text-align:center;">Play the game my partner and I made in Scratch! It's a racing game you can play with a friend! Use the arrow keys to move the blue car and w, a, d to move the red car. Once the gamne starts, the cars move on their own, but players need to steers them. We also programmed the cars to move faster on the track than on blank areas to encourage people to stay on the track. We created a counter on the finish line so that everytime a car crosses the finish line, the counter adds another lap to its total.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"> This is the app that my partner and I created on MIT app inventor. It is called Trivia Break and it focuses on technology trivia. It is a multiple choice game and only moves onto the next question after the user has answered correctly.In order to create the game, we made a separate screen for for each question. Each screen has different buttons that give the answer choices for that question. When clicked, the buttons turn red if they are an incorrect answer and green if they are the correct answer. There are eight questions total. When the user finishes answering all of them, there is a button that they can click to play again. </p>
